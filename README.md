# Lantern
Lantern is a Chromium extension that, when turned on, stores incognito history.  
  
**Please note that this is not the best way to maintain two separate histories. The best way is to have two separate browsers or two separate profiles.** 
However, if you have an invasive overseer (or similar) and you want an inconspicuous little icon hidden amongst many instead of something so visible, Lantern has your back.  

- Easy to use
- Can be disabled
- Allows you to bookmark pages
